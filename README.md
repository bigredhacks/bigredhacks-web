# Welcome

Hi team!  
  
Welcome to the official BigRed//Hacks Organizer Guide.

I started this Gitbook as a way to document the team's journey in organizing the 2019 BigRed//Hacks event. This will be my fifth time organizing a hackathon \(previously IncubateDFW, EagleHacks, BigRed//Hacks SP17, and BigRed//Hacks FA18\), but my first time being a hackathon director. I am still learning how to put together a hackathon, and want to document everything that I experience and learn in order to help out future events. I want to make organizing BigRed//Hacks as smooth as it can be for the team, and put on a fantastic event for the hackers, mentors, volunteers, and organizers. I hope that this will be a useful resource for all current and future organizers of BigRed//Hacks. Let's make the next BigRed//Hacks a great experience :\)

Yours truly,

Katie  
Executive Co-Director 2019
