## What is the pcard?

The pcard stands for "purchase card" and is what we use to buy everything that we need for workshops, small events, some team socials, and the BigRed//Hacks main event.

## Who is our CIS contact for pcard questions?

Stacey Stone is the lovely person we go to whenever we have any financial questions, or need help buying anything.

## Who has the pcard?

The current Finance Director should have the pcard. When a new Finance Director takes over, a new pcard is applied for in the new director's name and the old pcard is cancelled.
