                    | You'll have to solve several puzzles. Our puzzles are separate from bigredhacks.com from here, so you'll have to
                    | use the solution of each puzzle to get to the next. We're hosting all of our puzzles at https://wayel.bigredhacks.com/, so when you think you have a
                    | solution, just append it to the link.
                    | For example, if the solution to your puzzle is amazing_solution, the next puzzle is at <a href="https://wayel.bigredhacks.com/amazing_solution">https://wayel.bigredhacks.com/amazing_solution</a>. Try it now with that solution!
